A hedge fund is a kind of investment vehicle run by a small team of professional traders and managers. Unlike a mutual fund or a pension fund, a hedge fund usually has fewer of the regulatory constraints that apply to those traditional investment pools. Because of that lighter oversight it can take on strategies that are much riskier, such as using derivatives, borrowing heavily, or concentrating on a single sector, in the hope of generating higher returns for its investors. The trade‑off is that losses can be large and rapid, but the managers are typically compensated with a share of the profits, so everyone is aligned on taking big bets.

In this project, the we are adopting the role of a team within a hedge fund that is specializing in the futures market. A futures contract is the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed delivery price on a fixed delivery date. While the underlying asset can be a physical entity, such as precious metals, it can alternatively be a market index, such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq‑100. In this case, the contract is settled by the buyer paying the seller the difference between the delivery price and the index, which can be negative. To avoid large debts accumulating from one party to the other, these contracts are "marked to market", meaning differences are settled each day based on movement of the index since the last settlement.

Consider the example of an investor buying a future of Index A, currently trading at 10,000 points. The exchange packages the future with a contract multiplier of \$50 times the value of the index, meaning a single contract is worth \$500,000. If A increases to 10,100 points the following day, the seller owes the buyer (10,100-10,000)*(contract multiplier)* = (100)($50) = $5,000. However, if A decreases to 9,500, the buyer owes the seller (10,000-9,500)*(contract multiplier)* = (500)($50) = $25,000.

Since these contracts are marked to market, meaning past index movements have already been realized, there typically is not an up-front cost for entering a position. However, to ensure solvency of the parties, each party provides and maintains a margin. A margin is an account from which losses can be drawn and to which gains can be deposited. Rather than requiring the full contract value to open a position a typical margin may be between 3-12% of the contract's value. Therefore, an investor can benefit or suffer from the variation on a contract of much larger value than the quantity invested. This effect is known as leverage, which is a high-risk strategy that is often used by hedge funds.

Suppose that, in the previous example, the investor opens the position with a 5% margin, or (0.05)($500,000) = $25,000. Then, an increase of the index from 10,000 to 10,100 points corresponds to a new contract value of $505,000, a 1% increase. However, the $5,000 gain corresponds to a 20% increase relative to sum of $5,000 actually invested. In this example, the 5% margin creates a leverage of 1/0.05 = 20:1. 

In accordance with an aggressive policy set by the fund, the team decides to use the futures market to invest with higher leverage than would be possible by trading the underlying stocks directly. The team decides to trade according to the following rule. At the close of trading on day n they look at historical index price movement and predict whether the index will close higher or lower on day n + 1. If they predict an increase, they buy futures on the index at the open of day n + 1. If they predict a decrease they sell their futures. Regardless of movement over the course of the day, they hold that position until closing, at which point their position is marked to market and either a profit or loss realized.
