A hedge fund is a kind of investment vehicle run by a small team of professional traders and managers. Unlike a mutual fund or a pension fund, a hedge fund usually has fewer of the regulatory constraints that apply to those traditional investment pools. Because of that lighter oversight it can take on strategies that are much riskier, such as using derivatives, borrowing heavily, or concentrating on a single sector, in the hope of generating higher returns for its investors. The trade‑off is that losses can be large and rapid, but the managers are typically compensated with a share of the profits, so everyone is aligned on taking big bets.

In the project we’re describing the team has decided to specialize on the futures market. A futures contract is the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed delivery price on a fixed delivery date. While the underlying asset can be a physical entity, such as precious metals, it can alternatively be a market index, such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq‑100. In this case, the contract is settled by the buyer paying the seller the difference between the delivery price and the index, which can be negative. To avoid large debts accumulating from one party to the other, these contracts are "marked to market", meaning differences are settled each day based on movement of the index since the last settlement.

Consider the example of an investor buying $\$y$ of a future tracking Index A, currently valued at 100 points. If A increases to 110 points the following day, the seller owes the buyer $\$10y$. However, if A decreases to 95, the buyer owes the seller $\$5y$.  

The team decides to trade futures according to the following rule. At the close of trading on day $n$ they look at historical index price movement and predict whether the index will close higher or lower on day $n + 1$. If they predict an increase, they buy futures on the index at the open of day $n + 1$. If they predict a decrease they sell their futures. Regardless of movement over the course of the day, they hold that position until closing, at which point their position is marked to market and either a profit or loss realized.
